# Molecular docking scripts for virtual screening studies

This repository offers a case study for MDM2 using many docking tools.  
"ligands" directory contains a diverse ligand set.<sup>1</sup> The "list" file is a list of these ligands.  
eBoxSize.pl script calculates the binding center of the reference ligand (ref-lig.mol2) and defines the optimal box size.<sup>2</sup>
